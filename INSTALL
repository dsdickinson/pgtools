Basic Installation
==================

These are general installation instructions.

The installation for this software is very straight forward.  Just
take the nfquery directory and copy it to a location on your 
system. Then you can do one of two things.

1) Add the following to your $PATH:

/the/path/on/my/system/pgtools

Here's an example of how you may do that in a ~/.bash_profile file:

export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MAMP/bin/apache2/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/subversion/bin:/usr/local/bin/pgtools

2) Copy the executable for each tool to a common bin directory such as /usr/local/bin for easier access.

cp /the/path/on/my/system/pgtools/pglist.pl /usr/local/bin
